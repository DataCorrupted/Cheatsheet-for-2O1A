\newSection{Preface \& Usage guide}
This is \name. 
This preamble section should serve as a README section to help you contribute to this project and prepare for exams.
Ideally, this should be a repo for all problems in ECS201A: Computer Architecture.
Should you have anything to discuss or add, send us an issue or email contributors listed in Appx.3.

\newSubSection{Usage}

Type in \lstinline{make} to compile to a pdf file. 
You can turn \lstinline{showAns} in \texttt{main.tex:61} to \lstinline{false} to hide answers.
Should you have any questions, feel free to contact us.

\newSubSection{Selection pool}

As we hope we can go over and filter all the exams we have in hand, it is not possible with too few of us.
However, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers}{\textit{Law of large numbers}} tells us as long as we go over enough numbers we would get pretty close to the mean.
That's the reason we set up this selection pool, i.e. we only look for questions asked in this pool. 
We would record if the same question appeared outside the pool, just we won't be actively looking for new problems outside the pool.

Please use \lstinline|\st{<content>}| to strikethrough \st{contents} in the pool or add your names after it so that we know that this part has been done/been working on.

The pool consists of the following:
