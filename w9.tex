}{
    What is the goal of the memory hierarchy, as stated in class?
}{
    Makes the memory system perform as if made of fastest, cost as if made of cheapest.
}

\problem{
    \xxxxxx
}{
    Writes to a cache are inherently slower than reads from a cache. Why?
}{
    You can read the tag and simultaneously read the data location, Can discard the data read if the tag didn't match.
    However, you cannot do that on a write, because the write changes the state of the machine - you must first do the tag compare to ensure the write should, in fact change the state.

\problem{

}{
    Which is harder to write a program for, a shared memory machine or a message passing machine?
    Why?
}{
    Shared memory machine.
    Because you need to write the code for communication.
}

\problem{
    w19f0q24
}{
    Which is more expensive to build - a shared memory machine, or a message passing machine? Why?
}{
    Shared memory machine.
    Because you don' need hardware to support coherent and consistent.

}{
    Roofline plots what vs what? 
    Why is this information important?
}{
    Arithmetic intensity vs float point performance \& memory performance.

    It lets you calculate if you need to work on improving the memory bandwidth or the float-point hardware.
}

\problem{

}{
    AMAT
}{
    Average memory access time = Hit time + Miss rate * Miss penalty

    What is the goal of the memory hierarchy, as stated in class? 
    What two principles make it work? 
    (Two types of the same principle, actually).
}{
    \pg{72} The goal is to provide a memory system with cost per byte almost as low as the cheapest level of memory and speed almost as fast as the fastest level.
    
    \pg{72} \textit{Locality} of reference: \textit{Spacial locality} \& \textit{Temporal locality}.

    Which type of cache miss can be reduced by using shorter lines?

}{
    Which type of cache miss can be reduced by using longer lines?
}{
    Compulsive

\problem{

    w19f0q7
}{
    Using a different mapping scheme will reduce which type of cache miss?
}{
    Conflict
}

\problem{

}{
    The designer has the choice of using a physically addressed cache or a virtually addressed cache.
    Explain the difference (drawing a picture is fine!), and give 1 advantage for each.

\problem{

}{
    Find the Average Memory Access Time (AMAT) for a processor with a 1 ns clock cycle time, a miss
    penalty of 20 clock cycles, a miss rate of 0.10 misses per instruction, and a cache access time (including hit detection) of 1 clock cycle. 
    Assume that the read and write miss penalties are the same and ignore other write stalls.
}{
    \begin{align*}
        \texttt{AMAT} & = \texttt{Hit time} + \texttt{Miss rate} * \texttt{Miss penalty} \\
                      & = 1 \texttt{ clock} * 1 \texttt{ ns/clock} + 0.10 * 20 \texttt{ clock(s)} * 1 \texttt{ ns/clock}  \\
                      & = 3 \texttt{ ns}
    \end{align*}

    For each technique in the following table, indicate how(on average) the 3 terms of AMAT are affected.
