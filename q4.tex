    What is the definition of a basic block? 
    Why is there a desire to create larger ones? Give one example of a way to create a bigger basic block.
}{
    A straight-line code sequence with no branches in except to the entry and no branches out except at the exit.(Pg. 149)

    So compilers can optimize more.

    Loop unrolling

    What is the definition of a precise interrupt?
    Why it is a challenge in \OOO(OOO) machines?
    The two main techniques used today to provide a precise interrupt?
}{
