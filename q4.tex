    What is the definition of a basic block? 
    Why is there a desire to create larger ones? 
    Give one example of a way to create a bigger basic block.
}{
    A straight-line code sequence with no branches in except to the entry and no branches out except at the exit.\pg{149}

    So compilers can optimize more.

    Loop unrolling

}{
    Intel uses a Tournament predictor in some of their processors. 
    Describe what it is, and why it is used. 
    Your description can (and probably should) include sketches and drawings.
}{
    Tournament predictor is a meta predictor that predicts which predictor should be used

    It's used because each predictor performs differently based on the situation. 
    For example, 2-bit predictor performs better than G-share when we jump to somewhere new. 
    But after G-share learns, it will perform better.

    What is the definition of a precise interrupt?
    Why it is a challenge in \OOO(OOO) machines?
    The two main techniques used today to provide a precise interrupt?
}{
    When an interrupt happens, every instruction before it has finished and none after can complete.
    
    \todo
