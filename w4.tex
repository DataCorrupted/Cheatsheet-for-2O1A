    If a data word is aligned(where a word is 32 bits), what does that mean?
    (What can be said about the address of the begining of the data item?)
}{
    The begining address always ends with 2 zeros.

    When we talk about the number of operands in an instruction 
    (a 1-operand or a 2-operand instruction, for example), what do we mean?

    What are the two primary goals of a compiler(in order)?
}{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Make programs correct when compiled
        \item Make them fast

    Machines today use registers - often as many as they can.

        \item Pros

        \item Cons

            \item Fixed size

    A standard compiler optimization step is to do register allocation. 
    However, there are times when register allocation is difficult to do while maintaining programam correctness - explain why.

    You are responsible for designing a new embedded processor, and you have been told you must use a fixed 18-bit instruction size. To make this work you have decided to use a 2-operand instruc­tion format, 32 registers, and support 256 instructions. Your boss just came in and said things have changed, and you now can only use 12 bits - how would you change your instruction format? 
    Be sure to explain why you are making the changes (what problem are you solving?)

    Suppose we are considering two alternatives for our conditional branch instructions, as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item M1 - A condition code is set by a compare instruction and followed by a branch that tests the condition 
        \item M2 - A compare is included in the branch. 
    \end{itemize}
    On both machines, the conditional branch instruction takes 2 cycles, and all other instructions take 1 cycle. 
    On Ml, 20\% of all instructions executed are conditional branches. 
    Because M2 has the com­pare included in the branch, the clock cycle is 1.10 times longer than M1.
