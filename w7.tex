    What is the primary difference between superscalar and VLIW processors? 
    Give one advantage and one disadvantage of using each approach. 
    (Compare and contrast VLIW and superscalar with two advantage and one disadvantage.)
    (These have to be different - in other words, if the advantage of superscalar is X, then you can’t say a disadvantage of VLIW is that it can’t do X.)
}{
    \textbf{Superscalar}: hardware does dynamic scheduling  \\
    Pro: better at prediction and disambiguation \& no recompilation on hardware changes \\
    Con: only have a small window which it can schedule code \& HW complexity and more power consumption.

    \textbf{VLIW}: complier does static scheduling \\ 
    Pro: simpler hardware and clock rate can be faster \& compiler can see the the whole program to do scheduling\\
    Con: cannot use runtime information \& \warn{Memory ambiguity}\\

    Processors have been built that can issue 8 instructions at a time. 
    However, these pro­cessors are no longer being built - why not? 
    Why would you choose a 3-issue machine over an 8-issue machine?
}{
    Speculation requires a lot of power, and we don't get 8-issue very often because we don't always find that much parallelism, so it is not power efficient.
    I am wasting all of my energy supporting my 8-issue when I only get 3 or 4.

    OR

    8-issue machine has more hardware and does more speculation, and thus requires lots of power. 
    If we don't have enough parallelism available, it will have many bubbles and waste energy 
    Back then we don't care about that, but now the condition has changed and the energy efficiency is more significant now.

    Register renaming is used to avoid name hazards.

    Value prediction. 
    Identify when values are being used, and using them in advance when they are needed.

    The book states that slow and wide architectures can be more power-efficient than fast and narrow architectures. 
    Explain why. 
    Also, explain the underlying assumption that is being made, and why it is that we are still making narrow fast machines.
}{
    Slow and wide can lower both clock rate and voltage.
    Lowering $V$ and $f$ means the power goes down since $P = C \cdot f \cdot V^2$.

    If there is enough data-level parallelism, then slow and wide can provide the same throughput as fast and narrow while using less power. 
    
    But there is not always enough DLP though and thus slow and wide architectures' throughput is lower than the other's.

    You have been writing C programs for a simple, non-pipelined machine. 
    You have recently received a promotion, and now your job is to write C programs for a heavily pipelined, high-performance processor. 
    These new programs must execute as fast as possible (the emphasis is on response time, not throughput). 
    Give at least 2 examples of things you should do differently now, and be sure to explain in detail why 
    (what is the problem you are overcoming?)
}{
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item avoid using pointers: pointers screw up \textbf{register allocation} when compiling 
        \item inline functions: to make larger basic blocks
    \end{enumerate}

    Avoiding using pointers make the biggest difference in performance, 
    as in general application pointers are more widely used.

    Speculation is a very useful technique for improving performance.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Speculation is not free. It takes time and energy, and the recovery of incorrect speculation further reduces performance. 
            \item In addition, to support the higher instruction execution rate needed to benefit from speculation, the processor must have additional resources, which take silicon area and power. 
            \item Finally, if speculation causes an exceptional event to occur, such as a cache or translation lookaside buffer (TLB) miss, the potential for significant performance loss increases, if that event would not have occurred without speculation.
