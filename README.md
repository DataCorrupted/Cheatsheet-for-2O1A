# Cheatsheet for 2O1A

This is Cheatsheet for 2O1A.  
All detailed information is put in this cheatsheet, run `make` and you will see.

## Dependencies

This project requires `Make` and a proper distribution of `LaTeX`. 

You should also have a system-wide default pdf reader. I would recommend `Chrome` instead of `Acrobat`.
See [`Makefile`](Makefile) for details.

### Ubuntu
`Make` should already in your system. To install `TeX Live`, type in `sudo apt install texlive-full`

### Mac
`Make` should be in your system by default too. To download `MaxTeX`, go to [this site](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) to get `MacTeX`.

### Windows
You need to install Minimalist GNU for Windows([`MinGW`](http://www.mingw.org/)) first.

You also need to install [`MikTeX`](https://miktex.org/).
