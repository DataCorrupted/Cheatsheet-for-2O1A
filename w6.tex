    Accurate dynamic branch prediction is more difficult for which type of benchmark, Int or Float

    What is the definition of a basic block? 
    Why is there a desire to create larger ones? 
    Give one example of a way to create a bigger basic block.
}{
    A straight-line code sequence with no branches in except to the entry and no branches out except at the exit.\pg{149}

    So compilers can do more code scheduling and optimization.

    Loop unrolling
}

\problem{

}{
    What's an example of a commonly occurring indirect branch, and a hardware structure used to deal with it?
}{
    Subroutines / Functions

    Return address stack
}

}{  
    Compilers have trouble optimizing code that involves reads and writes to memory, why?
}{
    Hazard through the memory system.

    OR

    Hazards through memory system makes it hard to optimize the code by compiler. 
    Finding dependencies through memory is hard. 
    Compilers can't calculate the physical address at compile time, only hardware knows in runtime.

}{
    Why is loop unrolling a valuable optimization technique? 
    What are 2 challenges to using it?
}{
    It allows us to make bigger basic blocks to do code scheduling 

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The limited number of registers 
        \item Don't know how to decide how many times to unroll        
    \end{enumerate}

    OR

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Don't know how much to unroll  
        \item Register pressure        
    \end{enumerate}

    Intel uses a Tournament predictor in some of their processors. 
    Describe what it is, and why it is used. 
    Your description can (and probably should) include sketches and drawings.
}{
    Tournament predictor is a meta predictor that predicts which predictor should be used

    It's used because each predictor performs differently based on the situation. 
    For example, 2-bit predictor performs better than G-share when we jump to somewhere new. 
    But after G-share learns, it will perform better.

    What is the definition of a precise interrupt?
    Why precise interrupt is important?
    Why it is a challenge in \OOO(OOO) machines?
    The two main techniques used `to'day to provide a precise interrupt?
}{
    When an interrupt happens, every instruction before it has finished and none after can complete.
    
    To deal with page fault.

    \warn{Because instructions take a different amount of clock cycles to finish}

    ROB and \todo

    If a standard pipeline is modified to support \OOO completion, what new data hazard is introduced?
    If in addition to completing \OOO, instructions were allowed to issue \OOO, what new data hazard would be introduced.
}{
    WAW, WAR

}{
    What does ROB stand for, and why is it used in modern advanced pipelines? 
}{
    Reorder Buffer. 

    It can dynamically execute code while maintaining a precise interrupt.
