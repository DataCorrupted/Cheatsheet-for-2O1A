    What does ROB stand for, and why is it used in modern advanced pipelines? 
}{
    Reorder Buffer. 

    It can dynamically execute code while maintaining a precise interrupt.

    The book states that slow and wide architectures can be more power-efficient than fast and narrow architectures. 
    Explain why. 
    Also, explain the underlying assumption that is being made, and why it is that we are still making narrow fast machines.
}{
    Slow and wide can lower both clock rate and voltage.
    Lowering $V$ and $f$ means the power goes down since $P = C \cdot f \cdot V^2$.

    If there is enough data-level parallelism, then slow and wide can provide the same throughput as fast and narrow while using less power. 
    There is not always enough DLP though.

    Briefly outline how a Vector machine works, and what type of parallelism it is exploiting.
}{
    There are several vector registers(VR), fill them up. 
    Single instruction operated on these VRs, such that the single instruction do multiple operations on elements of the VRs. 

    Data level parallelism.

    You have been writing C programs for a simple, non-pipelined machine. 
    You have recently received a promotion, and now your job is to write C programs for a heavily pipelined, high-performance processor. 
    These new programs must execute as fast as possible (the emphasis is on response time, not throughput). 
    Give at least 2 examples of things you should do differently now, and be sure to explain in detail why 
    (what is the problem you are overcoming?)
}{
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item avoid using pointers: pointers screw up register allocation when compiling 
        \item avoid using recursions: return address stack can be overflowed 
        \item inline functions: to make larger basic blocks
    \end{enumerate}

    Avoiding using pointers make the biggest difference in performance, as in general applications pointers are more widely used.

    Speculation is a very useful technique for improving performance. 
    However, it is not being used as extensively as it once was - why not?
}{
    \warn{
        \pg{201}
        Incorrect speculation does not improve performance; 
        in fact, it typically harms performance dramatically lowers energy efficiency.
    }

    OR
    
    \warn{
        \pg{210}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Speculation is not free. It takes time and energy, and the recovery of incorrect speculation further reduces performance. 
            \item In addition, to support the higher instruction execution rate needed to benefit from speculation, the processor must have additional resources, which take silicon area and power. 
            \item Finally, if speculation causes an exceptional event to occur, such as a cache or translation lookaside buffer (TLB) miss, the potential for significant performance loss increases, if that event would not have occurred without speculation.

    A vector processor is a type of SIMD architecture. 
    What makes it different than a "normal" SIMD machine? 
    (Why does it have a separate section in the SIMD chapter in the book?)
}{
    Vector computers processed the vectors one word at a time through pipelined processors 
    (though still based on a single instruction)
    Whereas modern SIMD computers process all elements of the vector simultaneously.
