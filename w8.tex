}{
    What is a chime?
}{
    \pg{269} The unit of time taken to execute one convoy.
}

}{
    What is the critical advantage of a vector instruction set?
}{
    It allows the software to pass a large amount of parallel work to hardware using only a single short instruction.

}{
    Briefly outline how a Vector machine works, and what type of parallelism it is exploiting.
}{
    There are several vector registers(VR), fill them up. 
    Single instruction operated on these VRs, such that the single instruction do multiple operations on elements of the VRs. 

    Data level parallelism.

 }{
    A vector processor is a type of SIMD architecture. 
    What makes it different than a "normal" SIMD machine? 
    (Why does it have a separate section in the SIMD chapter in the book?)
}{
    Vector computers processed the vectors one word at a time through pipelined processors 
    (though still based on a single instruction)
    Whereas modern SIMD computers process all elements of the vector simultaneously.
}

\problem{
    \xxxxxx
}{
    Is it true that you can get good vector performance without providing memory bandwidth? 
    Why or why not?
}{
    No.

    Memory bandwidth is important to all SIMD architectures due to large amount of memory references.
}

\problem{
    \xxxxxx
}{
    Loops can be vectorized when they don't have what?
}{
    Dependences between iterations of a loop, or loop-carried dependences.
}

}{
    Writes to a cache are inherently slower than reads from a cache - why?
}{
    Read can do check tags and read data in parallel. 
    However, writing is inherently serial/sequential, so we have to check tags before writing the data to the cache.

    Given a 1 Megabyte physical memory, a 22-bit Virtual address, and a page size of 1K bytes, write down the number of entries in the Page Table, and the width of each entry.

    Given a 1 Megabyte physical memory, a 34-bit Virtual address, and a page size of 2K bytes, write down the number of entries in the Page Table, and the width of each entry. Is there a problem with this configuration? If so, what is the problem?

    Problem: It is too large to store in 1M physical memory. We can use two page tables. One is base, another one is secondary.
