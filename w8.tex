}{
    Briefly outline how a Vector machine works, and what type of parallelism it is exploiting.
}{
    There are several vector registers(VR), fill them up. 
    Single instruction operated on these VRs, such that the single instruction do multiple operations on elements of the VRs. 

    Data level parallelism.

}{
    A vector processor is a type of SIMD architecture. 
    What makes it different than a "normal" SIMD machine? 
    (Why does it have a separate section in the SIMD chapter in the book?)
}{
    Vector computers processed the vectors one word at a time through pipelined processors 
    (though still based on a single instruction)
    Whereas modern SIMD computers process all elements of the vector simultaneously.
