    What does ROB stand for, and why is it used in modern advanced pipelines? 
}{
    Reorder Buffer. 

    It can dynamically execute code while maintaining a precise interrupt.

    Writes to a cache are inherently slower than reads from a cache - why?

    What is the primary difference between Tomasulo’s algorithm and Scoreboarding?
}{
    Tomasulo’s: distributed; scoreboarding: centralized.

    Compilers have trouble optimizing code that involves reads and writes to memory. Why? (The answer has nothing to do with how slow memory is - that is a different problem altogether).
}{

}{
    What is the definition of a basic block? 
    Why is there a desire to create larger basic blocks? 
    Give one example of a way to create a bigger basic block.
}{
    A straight-line code sequence with no branches in except to the entry and no branches out except at the exit.\pg{149}

    So compilers can optimize more.

}{
    Processors have been built that were able to issue 8 instructions at a time using a fast clock. However, these processors are no longer being built - why not? Why would you choose a 3-issue machine over an 8-issue machine, if the clock rates were the same?

    Intel uses a Tournament predictor in some of their processors. 
    Describe what it is, and why it is used. 
    Your description can (and probably should) include sketches and drawings.

\problem{

    Why is loop unrolling a valuable optimization technique? What are 2 challenges to using it?

    The book states that slow and wide architectures can be more power efficient than fast and narrow architectures. 
    Explain why. 
    Also, explain the underlying assumption that is being made, and why it is that we are still making narrow fast machines.

\problem{

}{
    Supporting precise interrupts in machines that allow out of order completion is a challenge. Briefly explain what a precise interrupt is, why it is a challenge in OOO machines, and describe the main technique used today to provide precise interrupts.

    Briefly outline how a Vector machine works, and what type of parallelism it is exploiting.
}{
    \todo

    Data level parallelism.

    What is the primary difference between superscalar and VLIW processors? 
    Give one advantage and one disadvantage to using each approach. 
    (These have to be different - in other words, if the advantage of superscalar is X, then you can’t say a disadvantage of VLIW is that it can’t do X.)

    You have been writing C programs for a simple, non-pipelined machine. 
    You have recently received a promotion, and now your job is to write C programs for a heavily pipelined, high performance processor. 
    These new programs must execute as fast as possible (the emphasis is on response time, not throughput). 
    Give at least 2 examples of things you should do differently now, and be sure to explain in detail why 
    (what is the problem you are overcoming?)

    Speculation is a very useful technique for improving performance. 
    However, it is not being used as extensively as it once was - why not?
