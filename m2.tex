\problem{
    f15m2q1
}{
    Give 1 technique that can be used to reduce the Miss Rate.
}{
    \todo
}

\problem{
    f15m2q2
}{
    Give 1 technique that can be used to reduce the Hit Time.
}{
    \todo
}

\problem{
    f14m2q4
}{
    What does ROB stand for, and why is it used in modern advanced pipelines? 
}{
    Reorder Buffer. It supports Precise Interrupt.
}

\problem{
    f16m2q1
}{
    Writes to a cache are inherently slower than reads from a cache - why?
}{
     \todo
}

\problem{

    f14m2q1
}{
    What is the primary difference between Tomasulo’s algorithm and Scoreboarding?
}{
     \todo
}

\problem{
    f16m2q3
}{
    Compilers have trouble optimizing code that involves reads and writes to memory. Why? (The answer has nothing to do with how slow memory is - that is a different problem altogether).
}{
     \todo
}

\problem{
    f16m2q4
}{
    Why is there a desire to create larger basic blocks? Give one example of a way to create a bigger basic block.
}{
     \todo
}

\problem{
    f16m2q5
}{
    Processors have been built that were able to issue 8 instructions at a time using a fast clock. However, these processors are no longer being built - why not? Why would you choose a 3-issue machine over an 8-issue machine, if the clock rates were the same?
}{
     \todo
}

\problem{
    f16m2q6
}{
    Intel uses a Tournament predictor in some of their processors. Describe what it is, and why it is used. Your description can (and probably should) include sketches and drawings.
}{
     \todo
}

\problem{
    f16m2q7
}{
    Why is loop unrolling a valuable optimization technique? What are 2 challenges to using it?
}{
     \todo
}

\problem{
    f16m2q8
}{
    The book states that slow and wide architectures can be more power efficient than fast and nar- row architectures. Explain why. Also, explain the underlying assumption that is being made, and why it is that we are still making narrow fast machines.
}{
     \todo
}

\problem{
    f16m2q9
}{
    Supporting precise interrupts in machines that allow out of order completion is a challenge. Briefly explain what a precise interrupt is, why it is a challenge in OOO machines, and describe the main technique used today to provide precise interrupts.
}{
     \todo
}

\problem{
    f16m2q10
}{
    Briefly outline how a Vector machine works, and what type of parallelism it is exploiting.
}{
     \todo
}

\problem{
    f16m2q11
}{
    What is the primary difference between superscalar and VLIW processors? Give one advantage and one disadvantage to using each approach. (These have to be different - in other words, if the advantage of superscalar is X, then you can’t say a disadvantage of VLIW is that it can’t do X.)
}{
     \todo
}

\problem{
    f14m2q2
}{
    Which data hazard occurs when instructions are allowed to complete out of order? Which one occurs
when instructions are allowed to issue out of order?
}{
    \todo
}

\problem{
    f14m2q5
}{
    Speculation is a very useful technique for improving performance. However, it is not being used as
extensively as it once was - why not?
}{
    \todo

\problem{
    f14m2q5
}{
    Compilers have trouble optimizing code that involves reads and writes to memory. Why? (The answer
has nothing to do with how slow memory is - that is a different problem altogether).
}{
    Hazards through the memory system.

\problem{

    The book states that slow and wide architectures can be more power efficient than fast and narrow architectures. Explain why. Also, explain the underlying assumption that is being made, and why it is that we are still making narrow fast machines.
