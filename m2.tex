    What does ROB stand for, and why is it used in modern advanced pipelines? 
}{
    Reorder Buffer. 

    It can dynamically execute code while maintaining a precise interrupt.

}{
    Writes to a cache are inherently slower than reads from a cache - why?
}{
    Read can do check tags and read data in parallel. 
    However, writing is inherently serial/sequential, so we have to check tags before writing the data to the cache.

    What is the primary difference between Tomasulo’s algorithm and Scoreboarding?
}{
    Tomasulo’s: distributed; scoreboarding: centralized.

    Why is loop unrolling a valuable optimization technique? What are 2 challenges to using it?
}{
    It allows us to make bigger basic blocks to do code scheduling 

    a) The limited number of registers 
    b) Don't know how to decide how many times to unroll

    The book states that slow and wide architectures can be more power-efficient than fast and narrow architectures. 
    Explain why. 
    Also, explain the underlying assumption that is being made, and why it is that we are still making narrow fast machines.
}{
    Slow and wide can lower both clock rate and voltage.
    Lowering $V$ and $f$ means the power goes down since $P = C \cdot f \cdot V^2$.

    If there is enough data-level parallelism, then slow and wide can provide the same throughput as fast and narrow while using less power. 
    There is not always enough DLP though.

    Briefly outline how a Vector machine works, and what type of parallelism it is exploiting.
}{
    There are several vector registers(VR), fill them up. 
    Single instruction operated on these VRs, such that the single instruction do multiple operations on elements of the VRs. 

    Data level parallelism.

    What is the primary difference between superscalar and VLIW processors? 
    Give one advantage and one disadvantage of using each approach. 
    (Compare and contrast VLIW and superscalar with two advantage and one disadvantage.)
    (These have to be different - in other words, if the advantage of superscalar is X, then you can’t say a disadvantage of VLIW is that it can’t do X.)
}{
    \textbf{Superscalar}: hardware does dynamic scheduling  \\
    Pro: better at prediction and disambiguation \& no recompilation on hardware changes \\
    Con: more power consumption \& HW complexity.

    \textbf{VLIW}: complier does static scheduling \\ 
    Pro: simpler hardware, save cost \& power efficient\\
    Con: cannot use runtime information \& \warn{Memory ambiguity}\\

    You have been writing C programs for a simple, non-pipelined machine. 
    You have recently received a promotion, and now your job is to write C programs for a heavily pipelined, high-performance processor. 
    These new programs must execute as fast as possible (the emphasis is on response time, not throughput). 
    Give at least 2 examples of things you should do differently now, and be sure to explain in detail why 
    (what is the problem you are overcoming?)
}{
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item avoid using pointers: pointers screw up register allocation when compiling 
        \item avoid using recursions: return address stack can be overflowed 
        \item inline functions: to make larger basic blocks
    \end{enumerate}

    Avoiding using pointers make the biggest difference in performance, as in general applications pointers are more widely used.

    Speculation is a very useful technique for improving performance. 
    However, it is not being used as extensively as it once was - why not?

    A vector processor is a type of SIMD architecture. 
    What makes it different than a "normal" SIMD machine? 
    (Why does it have a separate section in the SIMD chapter in the book?)
}{
    Vector computers processed the vectors one word at a time through pipelined processors 
    (though still based on a single instruction)
    Whereas modern SIMD computers process all elements of the vector simultaneously.
