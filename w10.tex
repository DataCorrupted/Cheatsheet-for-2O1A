}{
    If I add processors but keep the job size the same, am I measuring strong or weak scaling? 
    Does this correspond most closely to response time or throughput?
}{
    Job size same, processors increase: strong scaling, response time

    Job size increase, processors increase: weak scaling, throughput
}

\problem{
}{
    What is a Thread Block?
}{
    Threads that are blocked together and executed in groups of 32.
}

\problem{

}{
    What makes one instruction set harder to write a virtual machine monitor for than another one?
}{
    If instruction behaves differently when in user space and OS space, the VM can't execute directly on the hardware.
}

    What is the main difference between a commodity cluster and a custom cluster?

    Different inter-connection network.

    There are two major challenges to obtaining a substantial decrease in response time when using the MIMD approach. 
    What are they?
}{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Communication has a long latency
        \item Finding parallelism is hard.        
    \end{itemize}
}

    w15f0p3

}{
    Why is it difficult to come up with good benchmarks that will work across all types of parallel processors?
}{
    Because the message-passing machine and shared memory machine works differently.
    They have different algorithms, and different programming approaches.

}{
    Which is harder to write a program for, a shared memory machine or a message passing machine?
    Why?
}{
    Shared memory machine.
    Because you need to write the code for communication.
}

\problem{
    f13f0p3
    f15f0p3
    w19f0q24
}{
    Which is more expensive to build - a shared memory machine, or a message passing machine? 
    Why?
}{
    Shared memory machine
    Because you need hardware to support coherent and consistent.
}

    How do two processes communicate when running on a shared memory machine?

    Coherence refers to \blank is returned while consistency has to do with \blank.
    
    OR

    Using less than 20 words explain the differences between coherence and consistency.

    OR

    Give a one-word definition of coherence, and a one-word definition of consistency.
