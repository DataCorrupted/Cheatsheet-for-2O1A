}{
    What is a Thread Block?
}{
    Threads that are blocked together and executed in groups of 32.
}

\problem{

}{
    What makes one instruction set harder to write a virtual machine monitor for than another one?
}{
    If instruction behaves differently when in user space and OS space, the VM can't execute directly on the hardware.

}{
    There are two major challenges to obtaining a substantial decrease in response time when using the MIMD approach. 
    What are they?
}{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Communication has a long latency
        \item Finding parallelism is hard.        
    \end{itemize}

}{
    Why is it difficult to come up with good benchmarks that will work across all types of parallel processors?
}{
    Because the message-passing machine and shared memory machine works differently.
    They have different algorithms, and different programming approaches.
