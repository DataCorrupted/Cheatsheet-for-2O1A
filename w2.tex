\problem{
    \xxxxxx
}{
    Area on the die used to be the most critical design constraint.
    That is no longer true, what is the most critical factor now? Why?
}{
    \todo
}

\problem{
    \xxxxxx
}{
    What is "leakage" current.
    If Vdd is lowered, what happends to the amount of leakage current?
}{
    It is the current leaked when devices are off.

    Increases.

\problem{
    \xxxxxx
}{
    In an MOS device, there is a gate, drain, and source.
    Briefly explain how this device works.
}{
    \todo

\problem{
    w20q1q1
    \xxxxxx
}{
    According to the book, in 2003 high performance microprocessors were how many times faster than what would have been obtained by relying solely on technology?
}{
    \todo
}

\problem{
    w20q1q2
}{
    According to the book, there are two main reasons why the performance improvement of single chip processors has only been 22\% per year since 2003. What are they? 
}{
    \todo
}

\problem{
    w20q1q3
}{
    In the book they list 4 techniques that modem microprocessors use to try to improve energy effiÂ­ciency despite flat clock rates and constant supply voltages. 
    List all of them. 
}{
    \todo
}

\problem{
    w20q1q4
}{
    Price is a key factor in the design of computers for which class?
}{
    \warn{ Embedded system. }
}

\problem{
    w20q1q6
}{
    The ISA serves as a boundary between what two things?
}{
    Programmers \& hardware
}

\problem{
    w20q1q7
}{
    Approximately how much has latency improved over the years? 
    Approximately how much has bandwidth??
}{
    \todo
}

\problem{
    w20q1q8
}{
    What is the equation for calculating dynamic power consumption?
}{
    $$ \texttt{Power} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot C \cdot V^2 \cdot f$$

    Where $C$ is the \texttt{Capative load}, $V$ is the voltage and $f$ is the frequency.
}

\problem{
    w20q1q10
}{
    Why are there multiple dies per silicon wafer? 
    Why not just fabricate one huge die per wafer? 
}{
    $$ \texttt{Cost of die} = \frac{\texttt{Cost of wafer}}{\texttt{Dies per wafer} \cdot \texttt{Die yield}} $$

    Making large dies lowers the yield and thus increases the cost.
}

\problem{
    w20q1q11
}{
    As technological advances allow us to make both transistors and wires smaller and smaller, what happens to the power density? 
}{
    The power density is higher and it will become hard to cool them down.
}

\problem{
    w20q1q12
}{
    It is difficult for the internal processing elements on a CMOS chip to cross the chip boundary and communicate with things that are on other chips. 
    Explain why that is.
}{
    \todo
