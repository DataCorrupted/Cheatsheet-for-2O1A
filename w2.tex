}{
    According to the book, in 2003 high-performance microprocessors were how many times faster than what would have been obtained by relying solely on technology?
}{
    \todo

\problem{
    w20q1q2
}{
    According to the book, there are two main reasons why the performance improvement of single chip processors has only been 22\% per year since 2003. What are they? 
}{
    \todo
}

\problem{
    w20q1q3
}{
    In the book they list 4 techniques that modem microprocessors use to try to improve energy effiÂ­ciency despite flat clock rates and constant supply voltages. 
    List all of them. 
}{

\problem{
    w20q1q6
}{
    The ISA serves as a boundary between what two things?
}{
    Programmers \& hardware
}

\problem{
    w20q1q7
}{
    Approximately how much has latency improved over the years? 
    Approximately how much has bandwidth??
}{
    \todo

\problem{
    w20q1q8
}{
    What is the equation for calculating dynamic power consumption?
}{
    $$ \texttt{Power} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot C \cdot V^2 \cdot f$$

    Where $C$ is the \texttt{Capative load}, $V$ is the voltage and $f$ is the frequency.

    w20m1q15
}{
    Over the years, clock rates grew by a factor of 1000 while power consumed only increased by a factor of 30. 
    How was this accomplished without melting the chip?
}{
    \warn{
        $$ \texttt{Power} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot C \cdot V^2 \cdot f$$
        Lower $V$ allows us to increase $f$ by a square to remain the same power.

\problem{
    w20m1q1
}{
    Which has been increasing faster, latency or bandwidth?
}{
    Bandwidth
}

\problem{
    w20m1q18
}{
    There are two different types of power consumption, static and dynamic. 
    Which one contributed the most to overall power consumption 20 years ago? 
    What is the situation now, and why has it changed?
}{
    Dynamic 20 years ago, Static nowadays.

    w20m1q4
}{
    As technological advances allow us to make both transistors and wires smaller and smaller, what happens to the power density? 
}{
    The power density is higher and it will become hard to cool them down.

    w20m1q17
}{
    It is difficult for the internal processing elements on a CMOS chip to cross the chip boundary and communicate with things that are on other chips. 
    Explain why that is.
}{
    The wire inside is too small, moving a little charge can transmit bits.
    Yet the wire outside is huge, there are too few electrons to transmit information.
